# Racket Js

Racket JS is a macro in Racket that compiles into javascript.
It allows us to write a module in standard Racket syntax that compiles into javascript.
JS modules can be manipulated as a Racket object.
We can also take advantage of the Racket package manager to install/maintain/build javascript projects.

### Prerequisites

__[Racket Language](https://racket-lang.org)__

<= Racket v6.10.1

Versions higher than v6.10.1 will most likely work, but have not been tested.

### Installing

#### Step 1.

__[Install Racket](https://racket-lang.org)__

#### Step 2.

Run

```
raco pkg install "/<path-to-project>/Racket-js"
```

## Using Racket-js

### hellojs module
``` scheme
#lang racket
(require js)

(module/js hellojs

  (provide hello-world)

  (define (hello-world)
    (displayln "HELLO WORLD"))

  )
```

### compiles to
``` javascript
var hello_world;
(function(){
    hello_world = function(){return js_displayln("HELLO WORLD");};
    return false;
})();
```

## Additional Information
send - equivalent to using class.method() in javascript
get-field - equivalent to using class.property in javascript
self - replaces **this** in Racket class syntax form
void? - checks for undefined
hash - hash compiles to json objects
vector - vector compiles to javascript arrays
object - Racket class objects match with javascript objects
display - maps to console.log
void-contracts! - turns all contracts off
>>* - compose async
l> - pipe
l>* - pipe async
